# About me
![gallorob](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32876132?s=460&u=04061a41dc379f3047290ed4621c9ade164f0f5e&v=4)


I am a MSc student at _La Sapienza (Rome, Italy)_ in _Artificial Intelligence & Robotics_. I did my bachelors at _Universit√† degli studi di Pavia (Pavia, Italy)_ in _Ingegneria Elettronica e Informatica_ (Computer and Electronic engineering).

I'm a decent Python programmer and lately I mostly write code for my thesis and university related projects.

You can find more weird rambles on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gallorob2).

Else, you can enjoy some half-finished projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gallorob).
