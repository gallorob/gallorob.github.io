I am a Junior Researcher in Evolutionary Computation at [Araya](https://research.araya.org/members/reinforcement-learning/). I completed my MSc at _La Sapienza (Rome, Italy)_ in _Artificial Intelligence & Robotics_. I did my BSc at _Universit√† degli studi di Pavia (Pavia, Italy)_ in _Ingegneria Elettronica e Informatica_ (Computer and Electronic engineering).

I'm a decent Python programmer and lately I mostly write code for work and some random experiments I come up with instead of sleeping like a normal person.

You can find more weird rambles on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gallorob2).

Else, you can enjoy some half-finished projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gallorob).
