## Return of the Blog

It's true.

The blog has been resurrected from the comatose quasi-death state that is a **forgotten repository**.

The main culprit was, clearly, the lack of time to properly look after it. Being almost done with my PhD now left me with plenty of time.

I am, of course, being sarcastic.

However, the face lift for this blog was long overdue. I have (somewhat clear) plans on things to add, edit, and customize.

Having a working local installation of Jekyll to test changes without pushing everything to GitHub definetely does help.

That's all. End of the update post.

P.S.: Given the times we're living in, I thought I should make this clear: this blogpost has never and **will** never contain LLM-generated content (unless otherwise **clearly** indicated). It is *my* personal place in the internet where I can express *my* voice, with typos (as few as possible) and sometimes clunky sentences.

That's all. For real this time.
