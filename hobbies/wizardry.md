title: Wizardry

"Wizardry" is a series of dungeon crawling games developed originally by Sir-Tech in the 80s.

I have been a fan of the series for years now (I think I played my first game of Wizardry in 2016), and have been playing on and off since then. Since 2025 however I have also been interested in the "expanded" Wizardry universe. That includes novels, mangas, and other media production (like the [official OVA](https://archive.org/details/wizardry-1-ova)). I have since then slowly started building my own collection, both physical and digital, which I am trying to preserve through the Internet Archive for everybody to enjoy.

## The videogames

While my personal favorite is the fourth entry in the series ("The Return of Werdna", incidentally the most hated entry due to its obscure puzzles and random difficulty spikes), I enjoyed the first three games ("Proving grounds of the mad overlord", "Knight of diamonds", and "Legacy of Llylgamyn") as they were bundled in the SNES cartridge I played.

Though, to be perfectly honest, I first played the DOS version of "Proving grounds of the mad overlord" because it was free to download and play.

That's how I racked something like 20-ish hours on my first playthrough. I was extremely slow in progressing, scared shitless I'd lose my party to a slime or some misidentified trap.

After I read the manual (which, admittedely, I should've done earlier), I beat the first game in 10 or so hours. I *did not*, however, completed the second and third games. I did almost complete Wizardry 8 (thanks to the GoG.com improved version) and I honestly have no idea how I lost my progress on "Heart of Maelstrom". The sixth and seventh entries of the series, to me, are the weakest games, so I played them for a bit but couldn't find enough motivation to put the effort in to see the game to the end.

On the other hand, I have been playing (couple of years or so, by now) "Wizardry: Variants Daphne", the latest installment of the game. Variants Daphne is a gacha (*eugh*) game, much to my disappointment, but it plays quite well on both Android and Windows (and Linux, though it's not ufficially supported).

## The non-videogames games

There have been multiple physical games with the Wizardry brand that were not videogames. While I own the first edition of the TTRPG, there are other games I know about but either no one is selling them, or they are asking for *way, waaaaay too much*. Still, I think it's relevant to have them here.

### Wizardry RPG

The Wizardry RPG is a Dungeons & Dragons-like roleplaying board game. After the first edition, there have been two editions that changed some of the rules and rebalanced some of the tables: True Wizardry RPG, and Advanced Wizardry RPG.

The game is played as any DnD TTRPG, with a Game Master and a party of players. There are multiple scenarios players can choose for their adventure. In the starter box (which I own), there is the "Proving grounds of the mad overlord" scenario (adapted from the first game), "Sponsor is Boltac" (スポンサーはボルタック), and "Bride of the Black Crystal" (黒き水晶の花嫁). A "Trebor's Campaign" box was also released. Finally, three larger scenarios were available: "The Shield of Daros" (ダロスの盾), "Seeking the Gnome's Gold" (ノームの黄金を求め), and "The Scarlet Gale of Gazal-Boda" (ガザル＝ボダの紅い疾風).

The English titles above are *my* translation, as the whole game was only sold in Japan.

While the game has **never** been translated from Japanese, just this year (2025) both I and [Akudai Teapot](https://www.reddit.com/user/Akudoi-Teapot/) independently happened to post our translation on Reddit. Given the much higher quality of their translations, I decided to focus instead on the mangas/novels translations and keep looking for material.

You can find the scans and my rough translation of the material I collected on this [archive](https://archive.org/details/wizardry-rpg-resources/), and Akudai's translations on this [archive](https://archive.org/details/wizardry-rpg/).

### [Tiltowait](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8776/wizardry-tiltowait-card-game)

Tiltowait (which is the name of the most devastating spell in the Wizardry games) is a Uno-like game with a Wizardry flair. Instead of numbers and colors, you have monsters of different types. Instead of special cards, you have spell cards.

But aside from that, it plays the same as Uno (kinda). That honestly does not justify the >400EUR asking price I've seen floating around. Though the cards have illustrations by Jun Suemi, which I find very appealing.

Which is why I have been working on making my own printable set of hi-res (AI upscaled) cards. This is still an ongoing project and I will share them over Internet Archive when I'm happy with the results.

### [Wizball](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6312/wizardry-card-game-wiz-ball)

Wizball is a fantasy sports game with baseball and magic. I unfortunately do not know enough about either to comment on it.

I also have been unable to find a single seller so far, and it's honestly not something I find interesting.

## The non-games

It's mangas and novels, of course.

Do Jun Suemi's illustrations books fall in either category? Probably both. I am waiting for a decent price drop before getting the latest reprint (2025).

### The mangas

I could spend quite a few paragraphs here talking about all the different mangas that have been published over the years, whether they were serialized in a magazine, who the writers were, etc...

So I **won't** do that here.

Keeping it short, I have been scouring magazins over Internet Archive in search of mangas chapters and have been keeping track of each, saving copies locally and building .cbz archives.

And also color correcting a good amount of them.

I am still in the middle of sorting everything properly, but I do have enough material to upload on Internet Archive and will have a [separate page here](this-page-does-not-exist-yet) with a comprehensive table for each chapter. I also plan to translate them in English so that everybody can read them and appreciate them.

So please look forward to it.

Aside from these older mangas, there are currently two mangas being released under the Wizardry IP: "Blade & Bastard" (based on the light novel with the same name), and "Wizardry Variants Daphne ～名もなき最後の冒険～", set in the Wizardry Variants Daphne game world. There is also a manga based on Matsuyama's "Ash and Youth" novel, but all references to Wizardry have been removed due to copyright.

### The novels

There were quite a few novels published under license. There are the official Futabasha Fantasy five novels based on the video games ("Proving grounds of the mad overlord", "The story of Alavik and Magda", "Knight of Diamonds", "Legacy of Llylgamyn", and "Heart of the Maelstrom", by different authors) which I do not own (yet), the Benni Matsuyama novels ("Ash and Youth: Side by side" and "Oh Wind! Have you reached the dragon yet?"), which I own the digital copies of, and some more novels such as "The return of Werdna" (which I own the digital pre-publish copy as it was an extra for a magazine).

I have, so far, fully translated the first Benni Matsuyama novel, and released it online on [this archive](https://archive.org/details/ash_and_youth_side_by_side), along with the original serialization scans stitched together in a single .cbz from the Famicom Isshobun magazine.

I am currently translating the second Matusyama's novel, but it's so much more work than expected given its page count. But it will be done, sooner or later, and I will upload that as well.

Currently, Kumo Kagyu (the author of "Goblin Slayer") is writing the "Blade & Bastard" series of light novels. While a bit on the nose sometimes (especially the characters name, like "Iarumas" being a "Samurai"), the stories are really enjoyable and include a lot of references to the original games. There is also the manga based on the light novel being released currently, and an anime adaptation is planned.

## Resourceful Resources

I realize I may not be the best person to explain everything about Wizardry. That's why below are a list of useful resources I personally recommend if you are interested in the world of Wizardry:

* [Wizardry wiki](https://wizardry.wiki.gg/wiki/Wizardry_Wiki)
* [Wizardry official website](https://wizardry.info/)
* [Wizardry Archives](https://www.wizardryarchives.com/index.html)
* [r/wizardry](https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardry/)
* [Snafaru's page](https://www.zimlab.com/wizardry/)
* [Monster cards from all games](https://emonoya.net/goods/card/card_fc1.html)

## ⚠ Piracy Disclaimer ⚠

To be perfectly honest, fan translations and scans of (formerly) copyrighted material is a gray, murky legal area.

Of course, I will not post anywhere any of the currently releasing novels ("Blade & Bastard") or mangas ("Blade & Bastard", " Wizardry Variants Daphne ～名もなき最後の冒険～", and the manga based on the "Ash and Youth" novel).

What does this mean for the other mangas and novel translations? It means that there *shouldn't* be a problem posting them online. Again, as far as I can tell, I am not dealing with material under active copyright. Some of the comics where one-shots appearing in now defunct magazines. Longer serializations were released under ASCII Comics, and often rebundled into a single book.

If I am mistaken though, I will gladly remove the material I have posted.

Though I hope that, unlike what I've seen happening in the past, this would not mean that these amazing products of the creative minds of their writers would be lost forever.

My goal with all of this is to save these artifacts from being forgotten, and making them as accessible as possible. Just as in many other niche groups, there are people who are passionate about content that compliments the main product.

I am one of these people, I guess.
