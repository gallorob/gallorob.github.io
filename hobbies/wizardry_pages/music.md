title: Wizardry Music
---

While buying physical copies would be great for any collector, Snafaru managed to put together a whole bunch of Wizardry music that you can download. You can find it [here](https://www.zimlab.com/wizardry/).

Note that now all CDs are available, and some tracks are missing. However, it's a great collection of all relevant Wizardry music information.

## Wizardry CD Drama 1

However, what Snafaru does not have (while I do) is the Wizardry CD Drama 1.

Aside from the music, the CD tells the story of Aran and Maria, and their attempt to recover the sword Hansil and the Diamond Knight's equipment (the God Armor) to overthrow the demon Dabalpus.

I quite enjoyed the voice acting in the drama, it reminded me a lot of the slightly exaggerated voice acting in the Wizardry OVA and the old Lodoss War anime series.

With the power of machine learning, below is the English translation of each track.

### 01: Monster Allocation Center

*(Screams, roaring sounds)*

Aran: Don't worry about the Fighter and Mage! Priest, seal his spell!

Maria: Aran!

Aran: We will take out the High Ninja!

Aran: Eat this!

Mercenary A: Unmiserable Destruction, Great Horde Annihilation. Unmiserable Destruction, Great Horde Annihilation.

Maria: Alluring Profundity Exists, Unsealed Thorns. Alluring Profundity Exists, Unsealed Thorns.

Mercenary B: Alluring Banner Exists, he he he, Alluring Banner Exists.

Mercenary: Ah... Buddy? Who... Nngh!

*(Explosion, Screams)*

High Ninja: Ngaah...

Aran: Is everyone safe?!

Mercenary: Ah... somehow, yes.

Aran: What about Maria?

Maria: I'm fine.

Aran: The Legendary Sword should be here.

Maria: There isn't any sword like that here.

Aran: It wasn't on this Ninja either... In that case, a Ninja of even higher rank must have it...

Maria: The lowest layer... You mean the one said to live on the 10th underground floor?

Mercenary A: Tch. So it's all pain and no gain, huh?

Mercenary B: I was moments away from dying back here.

Aran: That's because you guys failed to seal the High Priest's spell!

Mercenary A: What did you say!?

Mercenary B: Now, now, you two. Sorry, but we can't go along with you guys any further.

Aran: I'm paying you a sufficient reward!

Mercenary A: That only matters if we're alive to spend it. Even this ""Allocation Center"" was dangerous enough... no way in hell are we going to the lowest layer.

Mercenary B: Besides... you guys are a little too reckless. I don't know what your goal is, but at this rate, getting "Lost" isn't too far off for you.

Mercenary A: Anyway, we've decided. We are all dropping out. We'll take our pay up through today. Thanks.

Aran: Hey, wait!

Maria: Aran...

Aran: Damn it! No matter what, I will get my hands on that legendary sword... Hansil!
