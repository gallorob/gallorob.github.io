title: Wizardry Music
---

While buying physical copies would be great for any collector, Snafaru managed to put together a whole bunch of Wizardry music that you can download. You can find it [here](https://www.zimlab.com/wizardry/).

Note that now all CDs are available, and some tracks are missing. However, it's a great collection of all relevant Wizardry music information.

## Wizardry CD Drama 1

However, what Snafaru does not have (while I do) is the Wizardry CD Drama 1.

Aside from the music, the CD tells the story of Alan and Maria, and their attempt to recover the sword Hansil and the Diamond Knight's equipment (the God Armor) to overthrow the demon Davalpus.

I quite enjoyed the voice acting in the drama, it reminded me a lot of the slightly exaggerated voice acting in the Wizardry OVA and the old Lodoss War anime series.

With the power of machine learning, below is the English translation of each track.

### 01: Monster Allocation Center (04:08)

*(Screams, roaring sounds)*

Aran: Don't worry about the Fighter and Mage! Priest, seal his spell!

Maria: Aran!

Aran: We will take out the High Ninja!

Aran: Eat this!

Mercenary A: Unmiserable Destruction, Great Horde Annihilation. Unmiserable Destruction, Great Horde Annihilation.

Maria: Alluring Profundity Exists, Unsealed Thorns. Alluring Profundity Exists, Unsealed Thorns.

Mercenary B: Alluring Banner Exists, he he he, Alluring Banner Exists.

Mercenary: Ah... Buddy? Who... Nngh!

*(Explosion, Screams)*

High Ninja: Ngaah...

Aran: Is everyone safe?!

Mercenary: Ah... somehow, yes.

Aran: What about Maria?

Maria: I'm fine.

Aran: The Legendary Sword should be here.

Maria: There isn't any sword like that here.

Aran: It wasn't on this Ninja either... In that case, a Ninja of even higher rank must have it...

Maria: The lowest layer... You mean the one said to live on the 10th underground floor?

Mercenary A: Tch. So it's all pain and no gain, huh?

Mercenary B: I was moments away from dying back here.

Aran: That's because you guys failed to seal the High Priest's spell!

Mercenary A: What did you say!?

Mercenary B: Now, now, you two. Sorry, but we can't go along with you guys any further.

Aran: I'm paying you a sufficient reward!

Mercenary A: That only matters if we're alive to spend it. Even this ""Allocation Center"" was dangerous enough... no way in hell are we going to the lowest layer.

Mercenary B: Besides... you guys are a little too reckless. I don't know what your goal is, but at this rate, getting "Lost" isn't too far off for you.

Mercenary A: Anyway, we've decided. We are all dropping out. We'll take our pay up through today. Thanks.

Aran: Hey, wait!

Maria: Aran...

Aran: Damn it! No matter what, I will get my hands on that legendary sword... Hansil!

*(Music starts)*

### 02: Fortress City (12:32)

*(Tavern noise)*

Alan: I know that the person hiding the legendary sword of the Knight of Diamonds is someone with the skill for a critical hit. If it's not the ninja, then the only one left to consider is the High Master rumored to be lurking in the lowest level. We must hire adventurers to go down to the lowest level, no matter what.

Maria: Hey, Alan, aren't you being a little too hasty?

Alan: Sister, have you forgotten? That day. The day Father and Mother were victims of those filthy demons, and the day he claimed the name Llylgamyn. I want to avenge them and reclaim Llylgamyn as the rightful heir to the throne as soon as possible.

Maria: Alan, quiet. Someone's approaching.

Alheim: May I join your table?

Maria: Oh, yes, please do.

Alan: A Priest, huh? Don't recognize your face.

Alheim: It's been four years since I was last in Trebor's Castle. The vulgar behavior of the adventurers seems to be the same as ever.

Maria: Sir Priest, what is your name?

Alheim: I am called Alheim. My level has reached about Master status.

Alan: Then, have you learned all the spells?

Alheim: I haven't mastered Mabarlito, perhaps due to my low piety, but yes.

Alan: Have you fought Werdna on the lowest level?

Alheim: Well, you could call it the recklessness of youth. By the way, are you aware of a strange incident that happened nearby? Men and women of your generation have gone missing, or been brutally murdered. The rumor is that Davalpus, the Devil of Llylgamyn, is involved.

Maria: What?

Alan: Davalpus!

Alheim: Three years ago, when Llylgamyn was taken over by that fiend, it was said that the young Prince and Princess of the Ten Children escaped, but now he is reportedly using his subordinate monsters to seriously search for those two disciples. You two should be careful as well.

Maria: Alan...

Alan: It's alright, Sister.

Alheim: Oh, my apologies. I seem to have frightened the lady with my boring talk. Well then, I'll be going now.

Alan: W-Wait!

Alheim: Do you need something from me?

Alan: Would you go with us to the lowest level?

Alheim: To the lowest level?

Maria: We dissolved our party a few days ago.

Alheim: You intend to fight Werdna with such youth and inexperience? Don't attempt such a reckless thing.

Alan: No, we're not interested in defeating Werdna. We are looking for the High Master who is rumored to be lurking in the lowest level.

Alheim: The High Master.

Maria: We will pay whatever reward you wish, Sir Priest.

Alheim: I see, so there's a reason for this. Very well. My journey has no particular objective anyway. I shall accompany you.

*(Footsteps)*

Yuti: That sounds like an interesting story. If you don't mind, please let me join your party.

Maria: And you are?

Yuti: My name is Yuti.

Alheim: A Lord, is it? That's unusual.

Yuti: I've been in this town for quite a while, but my party members retired a little while ago. I had no choice but to go into the dungeon alone, and I just kept getting lost and lost. I've been lost for about a week now and couldn't find my way back to the surface.

Alan: Why do you want to join our party?

Yuti: Well, actually, my dream is to eventually be appointed as a knight in some country. Ah, a knight is so good! A splendid armor and a shining spear! And the women gazing at me with admiring eyes! Super popular! Puff-puff time!

Alheim: It seems your motivation is quite impure. By the way, my alignment is Evil, and yours is Good.

Yuti: I'm not the type to worry about that too much.

Alheim: I don't stick to things either. I was Good myself once upon a time, you know.

Alan: That settles it, then. Glad to have you, Alheim, Yuti. I'm Alan.

Maria: I am Maria, Alan's older sister.

Yuti: The pleasure is mine.

Alheim: Likewise, again.

*(Explosion, glass breaks, wood thuds)*

Adventurer: What was that for!

Weed: Because you went and searched my pocket without permission!

Adventurer: You bastard!

*(Sounds of fistfight)*

Maria: Alan, are those...?

Alan: Those are the guys we used to be in a party with!

Yuti: That Samurai, he seems to be blind.

Alheim: He's a Samurai. They read the opponent's presence that way. Even so, that Elf is quite a skilled fighter. It's like he has eyes in the back of his head, let alone being blind.

Alan: Those contemptible guys! I can't just ignore this!

Yuti: Right. Shall we help?

Alan: You lot, have some shame!

*(More sounds of battle, screams)*

Adventurer: Uooh!

Maria: Lazy Dispel, Lazy Dispel. That should do it.

Weed: That was a relief. Thank you.

Alan: Was our interference unnecessary, Master Samurai?

Weed: No, a helping hand. I am indebted to you. My name is Weed. As I am currently undertaking a journey to train and broaden my horizons, I wished to challenge the legendary Wardna's Dungeon once, which is why I stopped in this area.

Yuti: Then, why don't you come to the dungeon with us? Having a Samurai like you join the party would be incredibly reassuring! Right, Alan?

Alan: Absolutely! Please, join us!

Samurai: Hmm, perhaps being rescued by you is fate. Let us go to the dungeon together. We only need one more person to make six. We might just manage this. Do you have sufficient funds?

Maria: Yes, we are fine.

Samurai: Then, why don't we go to the Temple of Cant? We might find an unexpected hidden gem there.

*(Organ music)*

Weed: So this is the Temple of Cant.

Cant Priest: Oh, is this your first time here, Master Samurai? All the bodies enshrined in this temple are those of adventurers who lost their lives fighting the monsters under Wardna's command in the dungeon.

Weed: "Corpses don't generate Ki, after all. I'm not a big fan of places like this. We don't seem to have anyone who looks like they'd be useful here. With our current members, we'd ideally want one more Mage who can cast Makanito. Oh? The bereaved family of this Hobbit left a written message.

Yuti: "Let's see... 'My heart is with Eastern magic. I promise a service commensurate with the cost of resurrection.' Is this true? Did a dead body write this?

Cant Priest: Ah, that's Sams the Hobbit. He entrusted this note to me beforehand, asking me to 'please handle this if I am ever interred here'.

Weed: "That level of preparedness alone is commendable, and his level is also significantly higher than the others. How about it? Should we choose him?"

Alan: That will do. I ask that you proceed.

Cant Priest : Understood.
