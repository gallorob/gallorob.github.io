## Wizardry RPG

The Wizardry RPG is a Dungeons & Dragons-like roleplaying board game. After the first edition, there have been two editions that changed some of the rules and rebalanced some of the tables: True Wizardry RPG, and Advanced Wizardry RPG.

The game is played as any DnD TTRPG, with a Game Master and a party of players. There are multiple scenarios players can choose for their adventure. In the starter box (which I own), there is the "Proving grounds of the mad overlord" scenario (adapted from the first game), "Sponsor is Boltac" (スポンサーはボルタック), and "Bride of the Black Crystal" (黒き水晶の花嫁). A "Trebor's Campaign" box was also released. Finally, three larger scenarios were available: "The Shield of Daros" (ダロスの盾), "Seeking the Gnome's Gold" (ノームの黄金を求め), and "The Scarlet Gale of Gazal-Boda" (ガザル＝ボダの紅い疾風).

The English titles above are *my* translation, as the whole game was only sold in Japan.

While the game has **never** been translated from Japanese, just this year (2025) both I and [Akudai Teapot](https://www.reddit.com/user/Akudoi-Teapot/) independently happened to post our translation on Reddit. Given the much higher quality of their translations, I decided to focus instead on the mangas/novels translations and keep looking for material.

You can find the scans and my rough translation of the material I collected on this [archive](https://archive.org/details/wizardry-rpg-resources/), and Akudai's translations on this [archive](https://archive.org/details/wizardry-rpg/).

## [Tiltowait](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8776/wizardry-tiltowait-card-game)

Tiltowait (which is the name of the most devastating spell in the Wizardry games) is a Uno-like game with a Wizardry flair. Instead of numbers and colors, you have monsters of different types. Instead of special cards, you have spell cards.

But aside from that, it plays the same as Uno (kinda). That honestly does not justify the >400EUR asking price I've seen floating around. Though the cards have illustrations by Jun Suemi, which I find very appealing.

Which is why I have been working on making my own printable set of hi-res (AI upscaled) cards. This is still an ongoing project and I will share them over Internet Archive when I'm happy with the results.

## [Wizball](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6312/wizardry-card-game-wiz-ball)

Wizball is a fantasy sports game with baseball and magic. I unfortunately do not know enough about either to comment on it.

I also have been unable to find a single seller so far, and it's honestly not something I find interesting.
