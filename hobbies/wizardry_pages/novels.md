title: Wizardry Novels

There were quite a few novels published under license. There are the official Futabasha Fantasy five novels based on the video games ("Proving grounds of the mad overlord", "The story of Alavik and Magda", "Knight of Diamonds", "Legacy of Llylgamyn", and "Heart of the Maelstrom", by different authors) which I do not own (yet), the Benni Matsuyama novels ("Ash and Youth: Side by side" and "Oh Wind! Have you reached the dragon yet?"), which I own the digital copies of, and some more novels such as "The return of Werdna" (which I own the digital pre-publish copy as it was an extra for a magazine).

I have, so far, fully translated the first Benni Matsuyama novel, and released it online on [this archive](https://archive.org/details/ash_and_youth_side_by_side), along with the original serialization scans stitched together in a single .cbz from the Famicom Isshobun magazine.

I am currently translating the second Matusyama's novel, but it's so much more work than expected given its page count. But it will be done, sooner or later, and I will upload that as well.

Currently, Kumo Kagyu (the author of "Goblin Slayer") is writing the "Blade & Bastard" series of light novels. While a bit on the nose sometimes (especially the characters name, like "Iarumas" being a "Samurai"), the stories are really enjoyable and include a lot of references to the original games. There is also the manga based on the light novel being released currently, and an anime adaptation is planned.
