I could spend quite a few paragraphs here talking about all the different mangas that have been published over the years, whether they were serialized in a magazine, who the writers were, etc...

So I **won't** do that here.

Keeping it short, I have been scouring magazins over Internet Archive in search of mangas chapters and have been keeping track of each, saving copies locally and building .cbz archives.

And also color correcting a good amount of them.

I am still in the middle of sorting everything properly, but I do have enough material to upload on Internet Archive and will have a [separate page here](this-page-does-not-exist-yet) with a comprehensive table for each chapter. I also plan to translate them in English so that everybody can read them and appreciate them.

So please look forward to it.

Aside from these older mangas, there are currently two mangas being released under the Wizardry IP: "Blade & Bastard" (based on the light novel with the same name), and "Wizardry Variants Daphne ～名もなき最後の冒険～", set in the Wizardry Variants Daphne game world. There is also a manga based on Matsuyama's "Ash and Youth" novel, but all references to Wizardry have been removed due to copyright.
