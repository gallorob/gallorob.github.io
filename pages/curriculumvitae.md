# Publications

{% include cv_publication.html
title="Prompt Override: LLM Hacking as Serious Game"
date="2025"
authors="**Roberto Gallotta**, Antonios Liapis, Georgios N. Yannakakis"
venue="Accepted at IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) 2025 (demo track)"
description="This paper presents Prompt Override, a hacking-themed serious game that situates the player as a novice hacker that must collaborate with a rogue LLM to take down an LLM-operated infrastructure via prompt injections. By leveraging realworld limitations and vulnerabilities of LLMs, Prompt Override encourages players to develop a deeper understanding of prompt engineering, model behavior, and the ethical implications of interacting with intelligent systems."

title="FREYR: A Framework for Recognizing and Executing Your Requests"
date="2025"
authors="**Roberto Gallotta**, Antonios Liapis, Georgios N. Yannakakis"
venue="Available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12423)"
description="This paper introduces FREYR, a modular framework that enables large language models to use external tools more effectively without requiring model-specific prompting or fine-tuning. By decomposing the tool usage process into distinct steps, FREYR improves adaptability to new tools and reduces resource demands. Evaluated on real-world video game design tasks (LLMaker) and compared to traditional methods like the Ollama API, FREYR consistently outperforms existing approaches."

title="The Importance of Context in Image Generation: A Case Study for Video Game Sprites"
date="2025"
authors="**Roberto Gallotta**, Antonios Liapis, Georgios N. Yannakakis"
venue="Accepted at Artificial Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design – 14th International Conference, EvoMUSART 2025"
description="This paper explores the use of text-to-image generative models to create visually appealing, context-aware sprites for video games, addressing the challenge of repetitive visuals caused by sprite reuse. By introducing the concept of context---varying levels of detail in prompts---we demonstrate how sprite generation can adapt to different in-game environments. This approach, integrated into the LLMaker game design tool and applied to the game Dungeon Despair, is evaluated using both objective metrics and a user study. Results show that context-rich prompts enhance visual consistency and appeal, underscoring the potential for personalized content generation in games and beyond."

title="The Procedural Content Generation Benchmark: An Open-source Testbed for Generative Challenges in Games"
date="2025"
authors="Ahmed Khalifa, **Roberto Gallotta**, Matthew Barthet, Antonios Liapis, Julian Togelius, Georgios N. Yannakakis"
venue="Accepted at Foundation of Digital Games 2025"
description="This paper introduces the Procedural Content Generation Benchmark (PCG Benchmark), a standardized framework for evaluating generative algorithms across 12 diverse game content creation tasks, including level and rule set generation. Each problem features unique content representations, control parameters, and evaluation metrics focused on quality, diversity, and controllability. Inspired by OpenAI Gym, the benchmark is designed to be easy to use and extend. We evaluate three baseline algorithms---random, evolutionary strategy, and genetic algorithm---revealing varying difficulty across problems and highlighting how combining quality, controllability, and diversity objectives can improve generative performance."

venue="Accepted at ACII 2024 (DUNGEONS, NEURONS, AND DIALOGUES: SOCIAL INTERACTION DYNAMICS IN CONTEXTUAL GAMES (DnD-SIDC) workshop)"
description="This paper introduces the 'Affectively Framework', a set of OpenAI Gym-compatible environments designed to incorporate human affect into the training of virtual agents. By integrating affective signals into the observation space, the framework enables exploration of the relationship between agent behavior and human emotional response. We present three game environments and validate the framework with baseline experiments using random and PPO agents, providing a foundation for future research in affect-aware reinforcement learning."

title="Closing the Affective Loop via Experience-Driven Reinforcement Learning Designers"
date="2024"
authors="Matthew Barthet, Diogo Branco, **Roberto Gallotta**, Ahmed Khalifa, Georgios N. Yannakakis"
venue="Accepted at ACII 2024"
description="This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework, Experience-Driven Reinforcement Learning (EDRL), for generating affect-tailored content, demonstrated in the context of racing games. EDRL receives a target arousal trace and generates racetracks that match the desired emotional experience for specific player types, using a reward function derived from a corpus of arousal data. Compared to a genetic algorithm-based approach, EDRL is more efficient and robust in producing affect-aware and personalised levels. While both methods face challenges with underrepresented affect patterns, the results suggest that continuous, affect-driven content generation is feasible and applicable beyond games to any domain requiring personalised affective adaptation."
