I am a last-year PhD student at the [Institute of Digital Games (University of Malta)](https://www.game.edu.mt/people/). My thesis is on the impact of LLMs on designers' workflow and creativity.

Previously, I was a Junior Researcher in Evolutionary Computation at [Araya](https://research.araya.org/members/reinforcement-learning/), where I worked under a research grant by GoodAI to generate spaceships in Space Engineer that players may like.

I completed my MSc at _La Sapienza (Rome, Italy)_ in _Artificial Intelligence & Robotics_. My thesis consisted in evolving simple neural networks that would play Hnefatafl, an asymmetrical board game predating chess.

I did my BSc at _Università degli studi di Pavia (Pavia, Italy)_ in _Ingegneria Elettronica e Informatica_ (Computer and Electronic engineering). For my thesis I developed and trained a neural network to predict blood glucose levels up to 1 hour ahead for type-1 diabetics.

I'm a decent Python programmer and lately I mostly write code for work and some random experiments I come up with instead of sleeping like a normal person.

You can find more weird rambles on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gallorob2).

Else, you can enjoy some half-finished projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gallorob).
