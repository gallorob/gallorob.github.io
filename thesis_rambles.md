# Thesis rambles

## What's this?
This is where I'll be rambling about stuff regarding my thesis.

## Why's this?
Because after writing every report I get the urge to sarcastically explain to my old self how dumb I was.

## When's this?
Whenever I have time (and hopefully no later than September 2021).

## Where's this?
Here:
* Introduction to what my thesis is about (coming Soonâ„¢)
* [Summary of the first batch of experiments](_posts/2021-01-18-thesis-experiments01.md)

## Who's this?
A student with too much sass, obviously.
